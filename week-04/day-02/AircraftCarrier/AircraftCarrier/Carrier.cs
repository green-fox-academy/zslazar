    /*      Carrier
            Create a class that represents an aircraft-carrier

            The carrier should be able to store aircrafts
            Each carrier should have a store of ammo represented as number
            The inital ammo should be given by a parameter in it's constructor
            The carrier also has a health point given in it's constructor as well
            Methods:
            addAircraft
            It should take a string as the type of the aircraft (F16 / F35) and add a new aircraft to its store
            fill
            It should fill all the aircraft with ammo and substract the needed ammo from the ammo storage
            If there is not enough ammo than it should start to fill the F35 types first
            If there is no ammo when this method is called it should throw an exception
            fight
            It should take another carrier as a refrence parameter and fire all the ammo from the aircrafts to it, than substract all the damage from it's health points
            getStatus
            It should give back a string about it's and all of its aircrafts status like:

            HP: 5000, Aircraft count: 4, Ammo Storage: 2300, Total damage: 2280
            Aircrafts:
            Type F35, Ammo: 12, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 600
            Type F35, Ammo: 12, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 600
            Type F35, Ammo: 12, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 600
            Type F16, Ammo: 8, Base Damage: 30, All Damage: 240
            Type F16, Ammo: 8, Base Damage: 30, All Damage: 240
            If the health points are 0 than it should give back: It's dead Jim :(
